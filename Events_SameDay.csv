Amidst much fanfare, the SBP posted its highest ever profit of Rs1.16 trillion, against a loss of Rs1.04 billion in the same period last year.  Before partisan politics blows the numbers out of proportion, it is essential to understand how profitability of central banks works.The primary function of a central bank is to issue currency notes, regulate and supervise the financial system, be the banker for the government, and the lender of last resort. Revenue for a central bank essentially stems from issuance of currency notes, and by being a lender to the government. As of 30th June 2020, banknotes in circulation amounted to Rs6.458 trillion. Essentially, SBP can and will honor any of these banknotes that are presented to it, unless they are discontinued. These banknotes, which are a liability for SBP are backed by its assets, which primarily include investments in Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB), gold, investments and foreign currency accounts.At the same time, SBP held more than Rs7.2 trillion in PIBs, as well as gold valued at Rs617.4 billion. The mark-up accrued on the PIBs makes up major chunk of revenue for the central bank, amounting to more than Rs1 trillion. The mark-up accrued is largely a function of interest rates prevailing in the market which is in turn dependent on the monetary policy.  The mark-up is paid by the Government of Pakistan.During most part of the last fiscal year, yields on PIBs were well in excess of 12 percent which allowed SBP to accrue a significant increase in revenue. A sharp decline in interest rates following pandemic-driven change in monetary stance may be more apparent in subsequent periods. Similarly, during the period under consideration, the central bank also realized an exchange gain of Rs66 million, against an exchange loss of Rs506 million during the previous year. Higher international gold prices helped SBP accrue an unrealised appreciation of Rs613 million on gold reserves. Following such gains, SBP transferred Rs935 billion to the federal government, enabling it to plug its deficits.The growth in the profitability of the central bank is largely a function of double-digit interest rates which enabled accrual of relatively higher interest income, as well as an improvement in the price of gold, and a nominal exchange gain, compared to the massive exchange loss in the previous year. The magnitude of profitability and its direction is largely a consequence of monetary policy, and sovereign debt. This was a very simplified primer on the central bankÃ¢Â€Â™s accounting Ã¢Â€Â“ the underlying transactions and nuances are much more complex, and can fill up reams of paper.', ""Canada's main stock index rose on Tuesday as energy stocks gained on the back of a rally in oil prices on US presidential election day.The energy sector climbed 2% as US crude prices were up 3.6% a barrel, while Brent crude firmed 3.1%.At 9:38 a.m. ET (14:38 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 111.9 points, or 0.71%, at 15,808.77.The largest percentage gainers on the TSX were Constellation Software Inc and Torex Gold Resources Inc , rising 7.2% and 5.4%, respectively, after reporting upbeat third-quarter results.The financials sector gained 1.2%.

They are due to pare that further by 2 million bpd in January.But with soaring cases of COVID-19 in Europe and the United States and the recent swift return of oil supply from Libya following an eight-month blockade, Saudi Arabia and Russia are in favour of delaying the output increase in January.OPEC holds its next full meeting on Nov. 30.In another bearish sign, seven analysts polled by Reuters estimated U.S. crude stocks likely rose by about 2 million barrels in the week to Oct. 30.U.S. inventory data is due from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday and the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.', 'NEW YORK: Oil prices gained nearly 2% on Monday, shaking off earlier losses, as the United States heads into a contentious US presidential election.The oil market has been under pressure in recent days, hit by concerns about weaker fuel demand as several European countries went into lockdown to curb the coronavirus.

Further, US manufacturing activity accelerated more than expected in October, with new orders jumping to their highest level in nearly 17 years.US stock indexes, which energy futures at times track with, rose on Monday. Analysts said the election outcome most likely to shake equity markets in the near-term would be if there is no clear winner on Tuesday night, as several states remain where votes will need to be counted.President Donald Trump will face off against Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the election, which has spiked concerns nationwide about turbulence and protests stemming from the results.""The concerns over oil supply and demand fundamentals ... are going to play second fiddle to the US presidential election and to how risk markets will react to the outcome,"" said BNP Paribas analyst Harry Tchilinguirian.Countries across Europe have reimposed lockdown measures to try to slow Covid-19 infection rates that have accelerated over the past month.Global oil trading companies and analysts expect further demand destruction because of the resurgence of virus cases, though estimates differ.Vitol sees winter demand at 96 million barrels per day (bpd) while Trafigura expects demand to drop to 92 million bpd or lower.Rystad Energy sees demand peaking in 2028, instead of in 2030, and sees a slower recovery next year.""The lockdowns will stunt economic recovery in the short-term and in the long-term and the pandemic will also leave behind a legacy of behavioral changes that will also affect oil use,"" said Rystad Energy\'s Artyom Tchen.Libyan supply stands at about 800,000 bpd, up more than 100,000 bpd from a few days ago, a Libyan source told Reuters on Saturday.That, and the recent rebound in US operating rigs, is worrying investors concerned about supply again outpacing demand.Output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose for a fourth month in October, a Reuters survey found.OPEC and allies including Russia are cutting output by about 7.7 million bpd to support prices. This OPEC+ group is scheduled to hold a policy meeting on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with some analysts expecting a postponement of plans to ramp up output by 2 million bpd from January. Top managers of Russian oil companies discussed with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak a possible extension of current oil output restrictions into the first quarter of 2021, Interfax news agency reported.-Reuters', 'The benchmark KSE-100 gained as much as 1,387 points, or 3.5 per cent, in intra-day trade on Tuesday as an uptick in oil prices, rally in international markets and lower-than-expected inflation figures for October lifted the overall market sentiment.Today\'s rise comes after two days of panic selling ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ brought on about by fears of new lockdowns to combat rising coronavirus cases ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ during which the benchmark index lost a combined 2,678 points.But around half of those losses were reversed today, with the KSE-100 closing 1,368 points in the green at 40,480 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ up 3.5 per cent for the day. Commercial banks and cement stocks were among the top gainers.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe market witnessed a relief rally after the recent bloodbath. Sentiments improved as both international oil prices and international markets recovered sharply overnight,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â\x9d said Topline Securities Chief Economist Syed Atif Zafar while speaking to Dawn.He further added that inflation figures released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics were slightly lower than estimated but today\'s rally cannot be attributed to that alone as the figure was ""still on the higher side"". Inflation in October eased to 8.9 per cent compared to 9pc in September owing to a slight decrease in food prices. The figures were below market expectations as analysts had forecast the monthly price increase to clock in above the 9pc mark.According to Mohammad Sohail of Topline Securities, the rally being witnessed today was in line with global markets while additional support was lent by the rise in crude prices which in turn supported oil stocks.Oil prices gained nearly 3pc on US election day amid a recovery in global financial markets on Tuesday.Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 70 cents, or 1.8pc to $39.67 a barrel at 0845 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 futures were up 78 cents, or 2.1pc, to $37.59 a barrel, according to a Reuters report.Meanwhile, Ali Asghar Poonawala, Deputy Head of Research at AKD Securities, attributed today\'s rise to a ""pull back"" where investors were buying into the decline expecting to book gains as stocks gain momentum. ""This implies that yesterday\'s move was erratic and the market oversold,"" Poonawala said.""This pull back has been made possible in large part by robust improvements in reported earnings and payouts for the outgoing July-September 2020 quarter, with payouts in particular driving performance till ex-dividend dates,"" he added.Asian markets follow Wall Street higher ahead of electionAsian stock markets followed Wall Street higher on Tuesday as investors watched for US election results, hoping a win by challenger Joe Biden in the presidential race might lead to more economic stimulus.Benchmarks in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Sydney advanced. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.Traders are betting that Biden might push for a bigger US stimulus if he unseats US President Donald Trump. That would require support in the Senate, which is controlled by TrumpÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Republicans. Some incumbents, also up for re-election this week, face challengers from BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Democratic Party.On Monday, Wall Street closed higher amid indications Biden might be leading.Many investors expect a ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœDemocratic sweep, which is the key to unlocking CongressÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s ability to deliver significant fiscal stimulus,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â\x9d said Stephen Innes of Axi in a report.The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.1 per cent to 3,271.71 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 2pc to 24,956.10. The Kospi in Seoul gained 1.7pc to 2,339.29.In Sydney, the S&P-ASX 200 rose 2.3pc to 6,087.80 after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its key interest rate by 0.15 percentage point to a record low 0.1pc. The rate cut was expected.The central bank governor, Philip Lowe, said the RBA was committed to doing what it can to create jobs. The Australian economy contracted during the first half of the calendar year, although Lowe said he expects official data will reveal some growth in the September quarter.IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Sensex opened up 0.9pc at 40,131.45.

A sharp decline in interest rates following pandemic-driven change in monetary stance may be more apparent in subsequent periods. similarly, during the period under consideration, the central bank also realized an exchange gain of rs 66 million, against an exchange loss of rs 506 million during the previous year. higher international gold prices helped SBP accrue an unrealised appreciation of rs 613 million on gold reserves. following such gains, SBP transferred rs 935 billion to the federal government, enabling it to plug its deficits.the growth in the profitability of the central bank is largely a function of double-digit interest rates which enabled accrual of relatively higher interest income, as well as an improvement in the price of gold, and a nominal exchange gain, compared to the massive exchange loss in the previous year. the magnitude of profitability and its direction is largely a consequence of monetary policy, and sovereign debt. this was a very simplified primer on the central banks accounting the underlying transactions and nuances are much more complex, and can fill up reams of paper.', 'canada main stock index rose on tuesday as energy stocks gained on the back of a rally in oil prices on US presidential election day.the energy sector climbed 2% as US crude prices were up 3.6% a barrel, while brent crude firmed 3.1%.at 9 38 a.m. ET (14 38 GMT), the toronto stock exchange S&P/TSX composite index was up 111.9 points, or 0.71%, at 15,808.77.the largest percentage gainers on the TSX were constellation software inc and torex gold resources inc , rising 7.2% and 5.4%, respectively, after reporting upbeat third-quarter results.the financials sector gained 1.2%. the industrials sector rose 0.7%.the materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.5% even as gold futures ticked up 0.1% to $1,891.6 an ounce.on the TSX, 182 issues were higher, while 38 issues declined for a 4.79-to-1 ratio favouring gainers, with 13.84 million shares traded.aurinia pharmaceuticals inc fell 9.3%, the most on the TSX, after its drug candidate for the treatment of dry eye syndrome did not meet the main goal in a mid-to-late stage study, while the second-biggest decliner was bausch health companies inc, down 6.7%.the most heavily traded shares by volume were bank of montreal , nevada copper corp, and aurora cannabis Inc.The TSX posted one new 52-week high and no new lows.across all canadian issues there were eight new 52-week highs and one new low, with total volume of 25.11 million shares.', 'MELBOURNE oil prices slipped on tuesday as worries about soaring COVID-19 cases, rapidly rising libyan supply and U.S election jitters outweighed growing hopes that major producers would hold back on planned production increases.U.S. west texas intermediate (WTI) crude futures slipped 6 cents, or 0.2%, to $36.75 a barrel at 0159 GMT, while brent crude futures fell 15 cents, or 0.4%, to $38.82.italy is the latest country in europe to tighten COVID-19 restrictions, including limiting travel between the worst-hit regions and imposing a nightly curfew, which will limit fuel demand.demand has hit a speed hump as the resurgence in coronavirus cases around the world has resulted in new lockdowns, ANZ research said in a note.benchmark prices, down sharply over the past week, had a brief reprieve on monday, rising nearly 3% after russias oil minister held talks with domestic oil companies to delay crude output increases planned for January.Russian energy minister alexander novak met with the top managers of russian oil companies on monday to discuss a possible extension of oil output restrictions into 2021, sources told Reuters.The kremlin has effectively stopped two gaps with one bush -

Brent crude was up by $1.36, or 3.4%, at $41.07 a barrel.Both benchmarks extended gains to session highs after data showed US crude inventories fell 8 million barrels last week as Hurricane Zeta forced production declines in the Gulf of Mexico during the period.US weekly crude oil exports fell by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to about 2.3 million bpd last week, the biggest drop since January, and production dropped 600,000 bpd to 10.5 million bpd.Trump falsely claimed to have won after his Democratic challenger Biden said he was confident of winning a contest that will not be resolved until a handful of states finish vote counts in the next hours or days.Ã¢Â€ÂœPerhaps the biggest conclusion to be drawn at this stage is that there is only a small likelihood that existing oil & gas tax incentives will be removed in the US - even if Biden emerges as the winner - given the narrow margin of victory and a probable Republic majority in the US Senate,Ã¢Â€Â\x9d said Artem Abramov, head of shale Research at Rystad Energy.Wall Street surged and US dollar gained against a basket of currencies, as the too-close-to-call presidential election left traders betting on a divided Senate that would keep stimulus flowing but hold tax rises and regulation in check.Oil prices were also supported by the possibility that OPEC producers and Russia could consider deferring a planned increase in OPEC+ oil output from January as a second coronavirus wave stifles a recovery in fuel demand.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, earlier agreed to ease cuts by 2 million barrels per day from the current 7.7 million bpd from January.More lockdowns could, however, cap oil price gains and weigh on demand.

That followed similar news from Pfizer Inc last week. But the short-term economic outlook remains hazy with several European nations tightening restrictions as coronavirus cases increase. To tackle weaker energy demand amid a wave of new coronavirus cases, Saudi Arabia called on fellow OPEC+ members to be flexible in responding to oil market needs as it builds the case for a tighter production policy in 2021.OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and others, lowered its outlook on oil demand growth for 2021, according to a confidential document seen by Reuters. An option gaining support among OPEC+ nations is to keep the existing cuts of 7.7 million barrels per day (bpd) for a further three to six months, sources said, rather than tapering the reduction to 5.7 million bpd in January.Ã¢Â€ÂœItÃ¢Â€Â™s widely expected OPEC+ will push back on plans to increase production ... in January but with the Pfizer and Moderna announcements pushing oil back above $40, there may not be the same support there as there was just over two weeks ago,Ã¢Â€Â\x9d said Craig Erlam, senior analyst at OANDA. OPEC+ held a ministerial committee meeting on Tuesday that made no formal recommendation.

The main source of angst in Europe was Brexit trade talks which hung in the balance as London and Brussels tried to bridge significant differences in a last-ditch attempt to avoid a disorderly exit by year end.Other potentially market moving events were also eyed, starting with a EU summit from Thursday to break an impasse over a 1.8 trillion-euro Coronavirus aid package, as well as the last ECB policy meeting of the year on the same day.

The urgent tender floated by state-run Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) for second half of next month attracted the lowest bid of $9.58 per million British thermal unit (MMBTU) or 19.5pc of Brent for Feb 21-22 window from Vitol Trading and $8 per MMBTU or 16.3pc of Brent from Qatar LNG for Feb 25-26 window.  In comparison, the lowest bids from defaulting parties for almost same period were $11.48 per MMBTU or 23.41pc of Brent for Feb 15-16 by SOCAR of Azerbaijan and $10.22 per MMBTU or 20.09pc of Brent by Enoc of UAE for Feb 23-24.  Informed sources in the PLL said that SOCAR not only defaulted on its February bid but also tried to blackmail the PLL into committing about 11 carn market rates under government-to-government (G2G) arrangement without bidding. Documents seen by Dawn show the PLL and SOCAR remained engaged in talks until the last moment but the requirement for cabinet approval for G2G deal ended the process.   Replacement orders fetch cheaper rates Fortunately, the prices had already gone down in the market by the time the PLL floated urgent tenders.  Two major factors contributed to the LNG market crash. This included an intervention by JapanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s energy regulator to exit the spot market in an attempt to ensure that power prices do not go up further amid warmer weather conditions. Likewise, South Koreans also decided against securing additional gas for February.  As a consequence, LNG traders hoarding the product had nowhere to offload their cargoes, thus a fall in spot market. At present, European and Far Eastern importers are paying about $7.5 and $8.2 per MMBTU, respectively. Market analysts now expect the LNG prices going further down to abou2pc of Brent in April onwards period until October next year.  The petroleum division that seldom announces PLL bid results immediately claimed credit for the lower prices. In a statement, it said the PLL Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½has arranged one more LNG cargo at a lower price for the month of February 2021 through an urgent tender. The price is approximately 22pc lower than the price of the bidder that withdrew its bid earlier for same cargoÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½.  The petroleum division said this also put to rest the argument that Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ordering very early necessarily guarantees a better priceÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½. It said the time period between the bid submission date and delivery date of cargo for the urgent tender was 35 days as compared with 49 days for the earlier tender in the same delivery window.  The episode also established the fact that traders do not own cargoes, do not care about reputational damage and hence chose to default on Pakistani tender as they were e process, however, Pakistan is estimated to have got a saving of $7m-$10m per cargo when compared to two lost cargoes.  This means the government should move away from traders and encourage producers to participate in tenders. It is also important to plan and procure in advance in a bullish market while buyers have a better choice in bearish market. This is also supported by Indian advance bidding that resulted in $5-6 per MMBTU now being delivered.  Interestingly, the PLL has received bids for March 2-23 delivery window at the rate between $17 and $23.75 per cargo. All the spot cargos contain about 140,000 cubic meters of LNG or 3.2 million MMBTU.   PLL CEO Masood Nabi could not be contacted for comment despite efforts, but his close aides said the procurement rules were hampering competitive rates to Pakistan because 10-day period between bid opening and contract award provided bidders to move to greener pastures.  PLL sources said the SOCAR initially offered six cargoes for current year under G2G arrangements between Pakistan and Azerbaijan and when it emerged as lowest evaluated bidder for February tender, the company increased its offer to 11 cargoes at a rate almost a dollar higher than Japan-Korea market. This was subject to the condition that the PLL should not award the February cargo of 23.43pc of Brent SOCAR had won in bidding. The talks fell apart after consultant Wood Mackenzie voted against the offer for being uncompetitive in South Asia.Published in Dawn, January 23rd, 2021', ""KARACHI: Pakistan Stock Exchange Friday closed on a negative note due to selling in various sectors as investors opted to book profits on available margins.BRIndex100 lost 16.39 points or 0.34 percent to close at 4,847.87 points.

in disguise to pakistan as two urgent replacement tenders for february fetched about 16-18 per cent cheaper rates as international market plunged. the urgent tender floated by state-run pakistan LNG limited (PLL) for second half of next month attracted the lowest bid of $9.58 per million british thermal unit (MMBTU) or 19.5pc of brent for feb 21-22 window from vitol trading and $8 per MMBTU or 16.3pc of brent from qatar LNG for feb 25-26 window. in comparison, the lowest bids from defaulting parties for almost same period were $11.48 per MMBTU or 23.41pc of brent for feb 15-16 by SOCAR of azerbaijan and $10.22 per MMBTU or 20.09pc of brent by enoc of UAE for feb 23-24. informed sources in the PLL said that SOCAR not only defaulted on its february bid but also tried to blackmail the PLL into committing about 11 carn market rates under government-to-government (G2G) arrangement without bidding. documents seen by dawn show the PLL and SOCAR remained engaged in talks until the last moment but the requirement for cabinet approval for G2G deal ended the process. replacement orders fetch cheaper rates fortunately, the prices had already gone down in the market by the time the PLL floated urgent tenders. two major factors contributed to the LNG market crash. this included an intervention by japans energy regulator to exit the spot market in an attempt to ensure that power prices do not go up further amid warmer weather conditions. likewise, south koreans also decided against securing additional gas for february. as a consequence, LNG traders hoarding the product had nowhere to offload their cargoes, thus a fall in spot market. at present, european and far eastern importers are paying about $7.5 and $8.2 per MMBTU, respectively. market analysts now expect the LNG prices going further down to abou2pc of brent in april onwards period until october next year. the petroleum division that seldom announces PLL bid results immediately claimed credit for the lower prices. in a statement, it said the PLL has arranged one more LNG cargo at a lower price for the month of february 2021 through an urgent tender. the price is approximately 22pc lower than the price of the bidder that withdrew its bid earlier for same cargo. the petroleum division said this also put to rest the argument that ordering very early necessarily guarantees a better price. it said the time period between the bid submission date and delivery date of cargo for the urgent tender was 35 days as compared with 49 days for the earlier tender in the same delivery window. the episode also established the fact that traders do not own cargoes, do not care about reputational damage and hence chose to default on pakistani tender as they were e process, however, pakistan is estimated to have got a saving of $7m-$10m per cargo when compared to two lost cargoes. this means the government should move away from traders and encourage producers to participate in tenders. it is also important to plan and procure in advance in a bullish market while buyers have a better choice in bearish market. this is also supported by indian advance bidding that resulted in $5-6 per MMBTU now being delivered. interestingly, the PLL has received bids for march 2-23 delivery window at the rate between $17 and $23.75 per cargo. all the spot cargos contain about 140,000 cubic meters of LNG or 3.2 million MMBTU. PLL CEO masood nabi could not be contacted for comment despite efforts, but his close aides said the procurement rules were hampering competitive rates to pakistan because 10-day period between bid opening and contract award provided bidders to move to greener pastures. PLL sources said the SOCAR initially offered six cargoes for current year under G2G arrangements between pakistan and azerbaijan and when it emerged as lowest evaluated bidder for february tender, the company increased its offer to 11 cargoes at a rate almost a dollar higher than Japan-Korea market. this was subject to the condition that the PLL should not award the february cargo of 23.43pc of brent SOCAR had won in bidding. the talks fell apart after consultant wood mackenzie voted against the offer for being uncompetitive in south Asia.', 'KARACHI pakistan stock exchange friday closed on a negative note due to selling in various sectors as investors opted to book profits on available margins.BRIndex100 lost 16.39 points or 0.34 percent to close at 4,847.87 points.

MSCI\'s gauge of stocks across the globe hit a fresh record high and was up 0.2% by 1109 GMT, driven by gains across Asian markets and a steady session in Europe.Copper raced to a new all-time high as investors worried about missing out on further gains driven by expectations for improved demand amid tightening supply.Oil prices were buoyed after a cyber attack shut down a U.S. pipeline operator that supplies nearly half of the U.S. East coast\'s fuel.Europe\'s STOXX 600 index also reached a new historic peak after turning flat on the day, while MSCI\'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 0.6%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.1% while Nasdaq futures fell 0.3%.    U.S. nonfarm payrolls data on Friday showed jobs growth slowed much more than expected in April, a shock release that gave equities a lift but applied downward pressure on the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields.""A statistical fluke and/or a temporary pause in labor market demand is the likeliest culprit for this report. However, the Federal Reserve cannot afford to adjust policy without concrete proof of a stronger labor market recovery,"" said Natixis economist Troy Ludtka.On Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rose to record closing highs as the disappointing data on the U.S. jobs market eased concerns about a spike in consumer prices.In recent weeks, some investors had been placing bets that a robust U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic would force the Fed to tighten policy earlier than the central bank has outlined.However, the weak nonfarm payrolls report caused a rapid reversal in some of these trades, which rippled through stocks, bonds and major currencies.    U.S. President Joe Biden said after the report that the figures showed the economy was not at risk of overheating and underscored how vital his administration\'s economic actions are.""In the end, it is the best of all possible worlds for equities: robust economy, strong earnings, but no monetary policy tightening and more fiscal spending coming,"" said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan.The focus now shifts to U.S. consumer price data due on Wednesday, which will help investors determine whether they need to scale back their inflation expectations even further.    The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 90.136, just above 2-1/2 month lows hit earlier in the session.The pound broke above the key $1.40 level for the first time in more than two months, even as pro-independence parties in Scottish elections won a majority.The pound was up 0.75% against the dollar at $1.4095 .

MSCI gauge of stocks across the globe hit a fresh record high and was up 0.2% by 1109 GMT, driven by gains across asian markets and a steady session in Europe.Copper raced to a new all-time high as investors worried about missing out on further gains driven by expectations for improved demand amid tightening supply.oil prices were buoyed after a cyber attack shut down a U.S. pipeline operator that supplies nearly half of the U.S. east coast fuel.europe STOXX 600 index also reached a new historic peak after turning flat on the day, while MSCI broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside japan rose 0.6%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.1% while nasdaq futures fell 0.3%. U.S. nonfarm payrolls data on friday showed jobs growth slowed much more than expected in april, a shock release that gave equities a lift but applied downward pressure on the dollar and U.S. treasury yields.""a statistical fluke and/or a temporary pause in labor market demand is the likeliest culprit for this report. however, the federal reserve cannot afford to adjust policy without concrete proof of a stronger labor market recovery,"" said natixis economist troy Ludtka.On friday the dow jones industrial average and the S&P 500 rose to record closing highs as the disappointing data on the U.S. jobs market eased concerns about a spike in consumer prices.in recent weeks, some investors had been placing bets that a robust U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic would force the fed to tighten policy earlier than the central bank has outlined.however, the weak nonfarm payrolls report caused a rapid reversal in some of these trades, which rippled through stocks, bonds and major currencies. U.S. president joe biden said after the report that the figures showed the economy was not at risk of overheating and underscored how vital his administration economic actions are.""in the end, it is the best of all possible worlds for equities robust economy, strong earnings, but no monetary policy tightening and more fiscal spending coming,"" said giuseppe sersale, fund manager at anthilia in Milan.The focus now shifts to U.S. consumer price data due on wednesday, which will help investors determine whether they need to scale back their inflation expectations even further. the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 90.136, just above 2-1/2 month lows hit earlier in the session.the pound broke above the key $1.40 level for the first time in more than two months, even as pro-independence parties in scottish elections won a majority.the pound was up 0.75% against the dollar at $1.4095 . in the cryptocurrency market, ether rose to a fresh record above $4,000 and was last up 3%. bigger rival bitcoin fell 0.9% to $57,794. the yield on benchmark 10-year treasury notes was little changed at around 1.575% after having plunged to a two-month low of 1.469% on Friday.Three-month copper on the london metal exchange climbed to an all-time high of $10,747.50 a tonne after first breaking through a decade-old record on Friday.Copper also hit a record high on the shanghai futures exchange as the most-traded june copper contract closed up 4.8% to 77,720 yuan ($12,094.62) a tonne.analysts said friday disappointing april non-farm payrolls further fuelled the rally in metal prices as the dollar got hit.brent crude rose 0.75% to $68.79 per barrel as the disruption to U.S. supplies rattled energy markets, while U.S. crude added 0.6% to $65.31 a barrel. the white house was working closely with top U.S. fuel pipeline operator colonial pipeline on sunday to help it recover from the ransomware attack that forced the company to shut its main fuel lines.']","['https://www.brecorder.com/news/40091208/oil-prices-set-for-weekly-gain-despite-india-virus-surge', 'https://www.brecorder.com/news/40091666/stocks-cheer-prospects-for-low-rates-copper-shines']","['brent, , ']","['recovery in oil prices', 'oil prices jumped']","['pos', 'pos']",92.67,"[2.63, 5.65]",4.14,0,-3,3,0,"{

The bank\'s forecast is for Brent to end 2021 at $74.To reach $100, demand would need to average above 102.6 million bpd in the third quarter and grow to 103.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter, JPMorgan said, in the absence of any additional OPEC+ supply response.

It is a subsidiary of the Attock Oil Company Limited (AOC).Its product portfolio includes crude oil and natural gas, and it also produces LPG that it markets under its brand name POLGAS as well as its subsidiary, CAPGAS (Private) Limited. POL also produces solvent oil and Sulphur and has a vast pipeline network for transporting the crude oil to the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s refinery, and its associate company: Attock Refinery Limited (ATRL). Company associates and shareholdings. More than half of the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s shareholding rests with the Attock Oil Company (AOC), which is the group. A category-wise breakup of the shareholding is shown in the illustration. Besides Attock Refinery Limited, POLÃ¢Â€Â™s other associate companies include National Refinery (NRL), Attock Petroleum Limited (APL), Attock Cement Limited, Attock Gen. Limited, and Attock Information Technology Services.POL in the last 5 years POL has been an oil heavy company where its crude oil revenues have accounted for over 55-60 percent in the past, while natural gas has accounted for 20-25 percent of the total sales; A look back at FY15 shows that even though the company witnessed positive growth on the volume side especially that of crude oil, POL suffered at the hands of declining crude oil prices; At the same time higher exploration and prospecting expenditure further axed the profits for the year.  The companyÃ¢Â€Â™s revenue growth in FY16 remianed constrained as the oil prices touched historic lows, which also impacted the bottomline that declined by 14 percent, year-on-year. But unlike FY15 where the firm showed positive growth in production volumes, FY16 was marred with slowing down production by around 2-3 percent. This time however, some respite to the bottomline came from lower exploration and prospecting expenditure. FY17 was a better year for the E&P sector as the oil prices rebounded and POLÃ¢Â€Â™s revenues and earnings were up by 10 percent and 34 percent, year-on-year respectively after continuously declining for the two years. Where exploration costs remained under control POL witnessed a drop in production flows from its key Tal block.  FY18 was successful for POL in terms of new finds and operations. In FY18, POL made four new exploratory successes. Three of its development wells were also successful in the fiscal year. Revenues climbed by over 19 percent, and earnings grew by 17.6 percent, year-on-year. Growth in the topline came from better crude oil prices as well as highest crude oil production in the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s 10-year history. Exploration costs remained on the higher side for POL in FY18 due to seismic acquisition of Balkassar Lease, DG Khan and Gurgalot block, and dry and abandoned wells and some irrecoverable costs. What was an added factor to companyÃ¢Â€Â™s profitability in FY18 was the in exchange gains due to depreciating currency. FY19 was outlined as a better year for the oil and gas exploration and production companies not only because of higher average oil prices, but also a significant domestic currency devaluation. Both these factors were key drivers for earnings accretion for the E&P companies in FY19. POL also saw its topline grow by 25 percent, year-on-year, which came from around 14 percent year-on-year increase in international crude oil prices. On the other hand, volumetric sales remained tepid especially of crude oil with only slight increase in gas volumes. POLÃ¢Â€Â™s earnings for FY19 jumped by 48 percent, year-on-year; and apart from topline growth, lower exploration and prospecting costs and almost double other income helped lift the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s bottomline. The main factor behind lower exploration and prospecting was the absence of a dry well and also lower seismic acquisition. And other income increased due to currency devaluation.  FY20 was marred by COVID-19 and the lockdown, as well as the crash in oil prices which were key reasons for slowing earnings growth for the oil and gas exploration and production sector. Overall, POLÃ¢Â€Â™s revenues came down by 13 percent, year-on-year, where the 4QFY20 saw a 48 percent decline in sales revenue. The decline in revenue was due to falling volumetric sales as well as oil prices. During FY20, oil and gas production for POL plummeted by 13 and 9 percent year-on-year, respectively, while the average oil prices tumbled by 25-26 percent year-on-year. On the expense side, exploration and prospecting expenditure remained lower in FY20 due to the absence of any dry well during the year. With lower interest rates during, other income and finance costs also decline for POL. POLÃ¢Â€Â™s earnings in FY20 were hence flat. During the first nine-months of FY20, the company posted a growth of over 24 percent year-on-year in its earnings, showing that the fourth quarter (4QFY20) was a drag on the bottomline.  The earnings growth depends largely on international oil prices to pick up as production volumes have been diminishing in the E&P sector for quite some time. POL in FY21 and beyondAmid falling reserves, and fewer as well as small discoveries in a low crude oil price environment FY21 started off weakfor the oil and gas sector. Decline in production flows has been a key factor for falling revenues for the sector.POLÃ¢Â€Â™s revenues for 9MFY21 slipped by 13 percent year-on-year with 3QFY21 topline receding by 8 percent.

All players must take blame for collective failure. It is a combination of governance failure Ã¢Â€Â“ from banks to board of directors of Hascol and fiduciary malfeasance by the management. Loans worth Rs 58 billion given by 18 domestic banks have turned bad. Investors at Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) are said to have lost tens of billions of rupees. Given the existing dynamics, there is no way for banks to recover, albeit partially, money, without restructuring and restrengthening the franchise value of the business. With the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and others probing the company, there is a slim chance that lenders will be able to salvage their loans. It appears to be a mega scam, and it is likely to be dealt with as such. The rise of Hascol began with a Ã¢Â€Âœsmart and opportunistÃ¢Â€Â\x9d management team taking the reigns of the company in 2009. Hascol received an oil marketing company (OMC) licence in 2005 and was a small-time operator. Its market share was less than one percent at that time in the OMCsÃ¢Â€Â™ business. In 2013-14, aggressive expansion began taking place, and its market share peaked to 12 percent in 2017-18 Ã¢Â€Â“ surpassing the likes of Attock Petroleum and Shell Pakistan. It was second to Pakistan State Oil (PSO) in the market. The company was said to be doing unusual transactions. The market share was growing too fast. It was reported to be offering a substantial retailing and sub-distribution discount in an industry that operates on razor thin margins. The meteoric rise was too good to be true. Yet, the board of directors was happy Ã¢Â€Â“ as the company was making money. The banks were happy to lend as bank spreads were too lucrative. The company was listed at PSX in 2014. Its share price increased manifold within a couple of years Ã¢Â€Â“ investors were ecstatic. In 2015, Vitol Dubai Limited (VTL) Ã¢Â€Â“ a global energy trading giant Ã¢Â€Â“ bought 15 percent shares of the company and later increased its holding to 25 percent by 2016. The companyÃ¢Â€Â™s financials flourished with Vitol on board. This integrated the backend supply chain. Everyone was happy and making money. But overall, the business model was not sustainable which was ignored by investors and lenders. The company was expanding too fast. It was acquiring new location/sites by bidding higher. New storage depots were established. In its initial years, Hascol made money by importing and selling furnace oil (FO). FO sales jumped further after VitolÃ¢Â€Â™s investment. It purchased FO on credit and was able to extend credit to its clients. That is how it increased its market share and used that money to expand its franchises and storage capacity. In 2018-19, FO sales fell industry-wise as new power plants based on RLNG, and other fuels started coming online. HascolÃ¢Â€Â™s edge was in importing FO by having Vitol on board. The company landed in a tight spot with other costs beginning to hurt the company. Vitol started taking more control of the company by acquiring shares of the then chairman and CEO and brought in new management that disclosed to banks that the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s loans must be restructured if default is to be avoided. However, the story is not that simple. Vitol could probably try to recoup its money through charging higher amount in trading and other businesses. There are allegations of transfer pricing and misuse of power by the previous management team. For example, Hascol Terminal Limited (HTL), a joint venture of Hascol and Vitol, was commissioned in 2019. Twenty four percent shareholding in HTL is held by another firm called Fossil Energy. As per a whistleblower (in April 2020), Hascol paid throughput charges to HTL at Rs1.3 per litre on annual volume of 1.2 million metric ton as against the industry average of Re 0.3 per litre. How can a company pay half of its total margins to its terminal handling company and survive? Then there were other issues. VitolÃ¢Â€Â™s interest is in trading. Higher the volumes traded more money it makes. Hascol is a marketing company, and it supposedly operates on thin margins. The business model was rigged. For example, Hascol extended unsecured credit to one sub-supplier in Punjab to the tune of Rs 10-12 billion of which Rs 8-10 billion landed in default. Usually, the industry gives 5-10 days credit supply of 1-2 tanker loads. But the decision-makers at Hascol were said to be more interested in trading volumes than anything else. It is pertinent to mention here that allegations of financial irregularities are said to pre-date investment by Vitol. It is said that the purported modus operandi was to make sales on credit to attain market share in petrol and diesel sales. Insiders suggest several methodologies were used. They insist that credit sales were partly financed by higher FO margins; by selling fuel close to port while booking sales at far-flung areas to pocket inland freight equalization margin (IFEM). Moreover, it is said that the company sold fuel to other companiesÃ¢Â€Â™ retail franchises. While there is no concrete evidence of these allegations, it, however, does not make sense that a company would sell fuel at Rs3 per litre discount when the gross margin on the products is regulated and is less than Rs 3 per litre. The question is how these elements were not observed by the then board of directors of the company, banks, and Vitol (which purchased its stake in the company beginning 2015). The company was opening usance (deferred payment) LC (letter of credit). OMC business needs higher working capital (WC) financing, and which is extended on LCs. It is a high margin business and banks were happy to lend and make easy money. In usance LC, the company is exposed to foreign exchange movement risk. The price is locked in dollars and payment is made later. Usual OMC cash cycle is 15-30 days (itÃ¢Â€Â™s higher on FO and lower on petrol/diesel). Hascol issued LCs for 90 days which increased its currency exposure excessively.  In 2018, when the PKR stared depreciating, the situation started unravelling. At the same time, FO sales started dropping too, exacerbating the financial stress. In the quarter ending Dec-18, the company showed loss for the first time. And the loss started increasing in 2019 and 2020. The Covid pandemic did not help either. In June 2020, all OMCs were under stress when the international oil prices fell, and government passed on the benefit to consumers while companies were holding inventories (as sales were low in April and May due to lockdown) and they incurred inventory losses. The fall was too steep for Hascol. Their high-cost overheads were becoming visible. The higher throughput charges and substantial unsecured credit were aggravating the situation for them. There was no cushion from FO sales. The hour of reckoning was upon it, the company defaulted on its loans and has not published its latest accounts Ã¢Â€Â“ and is thus on the defaulters list on PSX. Meanwhile, the company issued right shares. Vitol increased its shareholding. Right now, 40 percent shares are held by VTL, and rest are in various hands. The control is with Vitol and banks have formed a consortium to negotiate with the company. Now, it is in the best interest of the banks to revive the company or else, they will not be able to recover anything Ã¢Â€Â“ especially, since more losses will accrue as the company recently stated that Rs7.5 billion worth of fake purchases were booked against its fixed assets.OMC business is based on franchise value. It operates on high volumes and low margins. Fixed assets have a lower share. As per OCAC in 2020, there were 531 retail outlets of Hascol in Pakistan out of 9,113 in total. The current number is 675. Around 95 percent of these are franchise owners while the remainder are company operated. Some storage facilities are leased as well. The company has a good retail network with pumps at key locations. For the company to revive, these outlets need to survive and thrive. However, with investigation agencies poking in, the brand equity of Hascol will diminish. Consumers may stop buying petrol/diesel from it. Franchises may go to other OMCs, as all they need to do, is enter in a new agreement and change sign boards and branding. But if that happens, the company will die. Banks will not be able to recoup even Rs10 billion out of their outstanding Rs58 billion. The consortium of banks is negotiating with the new management. Banks need to understand that they have to take a haircut. They will be living in a foolÃ¢Â€Â™s paradise if they expect full recovery. The other problem with banks is that each bank is trying to undercut the other by insisting that it has a first charge. Each bank wants to recover its full amount, but in the process everyone would lose. It has happened in the past, and it can happen now. In game theory, it is referred to as the prisonerÃ¢Â€Â™s dilemma. The other problem banks have is trusting Vitol. The company must restructure. Banks will convert part of their debt into equity and part of it into long-term financing. Then the company would need working capital to revive. For this to happen, banks would need to put more money into the company. They are contemplating the option of putting good money into bad in anticipation of turning bad into good.   Banks want Vitol to make full disclosure on long-term contracts. Banks expect Vitol to put further equity into the company. Additionally, Vitol, in principle, should not be the sole supplier of fuel to the company. There are too many ifs and buts. Seeing the past, it is in the best interests of the financial system to find a new buyer for Hascol and let Vitol make an exit. If Pakistan had strong bankruptcy laws, this management shift could be easier. Still, this can happen. But with FIA (and possibly NAB) in the picture, no new player would like to burn their hands. That is why it is important to deal the case as corporate default and fraud. Here the SBP-SECP role is critical. But SECP is toothless and does not have history or capacity to unearth and handle corporate frauds. It is high time for SECP to pull its socks up and do its job.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021', 'TOKYO: Oil prices climbed on Tuesday, reversing some of the previous day\'s losses, as tight supply and expectations of a further draw in US crude inventories provided support, although fears over the spreading COVID-19 variant capped gains.Brent crude for September rose 19 cents, or 0.3%,  to $75.35 a barrel by 0421 GMT, after losing 0.5% on Monday.
